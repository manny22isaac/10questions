# 10questions
### Sample Project

- Using just raw javascript, html and css, i want you to create a webpage that will display 10 questions and their multiple choice answers. 
- A user should be able to select an answer and be validated if it is correct. 
[eg: if a user select option a for question 1, then you let the user know if they are correct or wrong and keep scores. Let the user know their total score after answering all the questions.]


- Feeding this to chatgpt or any ai can easily generate the solution for you. But that will not be helpful to you for now. So do everything from scratch.

- Create a git repository and be committing updates to your repo.
